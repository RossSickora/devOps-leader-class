# ITIL VS DevOps

I’ve included my thoughts and links to a few updated blogs on ITIL and DevOps that I think have some good points. I think it would be an interesting discussion.

My personal opinion is that ITIL looks at efficiency at the cost of customer/user satisfaction. DevOps approaches efficiency though fast feedback from customers and users. However, I just found a quote from Gene Kim that I thought was interesting.

"For many years, I’ve felt that I’ve been the official ITIL® apologist in the DevOps community, because I’ve always believed that DevOps and ITIL should be able to peacefully coexist. But these days, I feel that a more activist role in the DevOps community is necessary - we must reach out and form effective bridges with the ITIL community, because ITIL is the most powerful and entrenched orthodoxy in large, complex IT organizations."

Below is one snippet from an article that I think sums everything up well:

Problem: The high demand on software requires much quicker turnaround of fixes and updates, as well at the integration of testing and QA into the development process. The traditional methods of deployment aren’t letting us keep up with the market.

DevOps: Software delivery is DevOps’ bread and butter. From the toolchain to the philosophy, DevOps centers on this process specifically, although it has expanded beyond that into general IT. The powerful automation of a tool like Puppet or Chef, along with a configuration monitoring and testing tool like UpGuard will help create and maintain standardized environments between development and production.

ITIL: ITIL has a very specific framework for delivering software and focuses more on integrating the delivery process into other business processes by defining stakeholders and establishing protocols. This complements the DevOps side well, because while DevOps has general principles, ITIL has detailed guidelines to follow.
 
Solution: DevOps is crucial to this process, whereas ITIL can fit, but isn’t required. ITIL by itself, however would miss many of the innovations DevOps brings.
